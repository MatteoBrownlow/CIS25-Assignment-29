Assignment Prompt:
Given following string, write a function to parse the below string into a movie structure.
“24 s2,2014”

This program passes that string to a function, which makes an array of movies (a struct in the program), and gives the first movie "24 s2" as the title and 2014 as the release year.
It deletes the array afterwards, but this code could be repeatedly used to store an array of movies as well.
